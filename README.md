# TentaP

The place where some of my preparations for exams in programming will hopefully be.

# Structure for algorithms course

If possible, I will try to include the following in every part:

1. Implementation in relevant language  
2. Pseudo code for implementation above
3. Visualisation
4. Asymptotic time complexity

# Usage

Each course (only algorithms at the moment), will have its own directory, with a runnable class that can run the different algorithms and data structures depending on what you want to run.
